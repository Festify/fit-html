/**
 * A ðŸ’ª redux store provider element.
 *
 * This element supplies the redux store to the ðŸ’ª-html elements below it.
 * It works much like {@see https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#provider-store}.
 *
 * When connected to the document, ðŸ’ª-elements walk the dom upwards until they
 * either find another ðŸ’ª-element that already has an initialized redux store
 * or the store provider element. They then take the store from that given
 * element, subscribe to it for rendering and cache it for further lookups
 * or potential ðŸ’ª-children.
 *
 * You usually only need one per application as you would usually only use one
 * redux store per application. You're free to use as many as you like though.
 *
 * You can also nest them into each other. ðŸ’ª-html components will always use
 * the store from the closest provider element above them. See the following
 * example:
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <redux-provider-top-level>
 *     <!-- These two elements use the store from redux-provider-top-level -->
 *     <fit-element-1></fit-element-1>
 *     <fit-element-2></fit-element-2>
 *
 *     <redux-provider-sub-level>
 *         <!-- These two elements use the store from redux-provider-sub-level -->
 *         <fit-element-2></fit-element-1>
 *         <fit-element-2></fit-element-2>
 *     </redux-provider-sub-level>
 * </redux-provider-top-level>
 * ```
