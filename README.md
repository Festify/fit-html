# 💪 fit-html

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Festify/fit-html.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

5KB functional web components without bloat.

## Overview

fit-html is a combination of [lit-html](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/lit-html) and [redux](http://redux.js.org/) bringing the best of both worlds - efficient rendering and a functional application architecture - together. Yet, it still manages to keep the total size of the framework below 5KB, including dependencies.

Just like lit-html, fit-html is in very early stages of development and thus is not suitable for production use yet.
